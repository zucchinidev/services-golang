# Services Golang Architecture

This project follows key architectural principles to maintain clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

## Core Design Philosophy

### 1. Package Boundaries
- Each package acts as a firewall/boundary in the system
- Packages organize APIs rather than just code
- APIs are layered vertically within their domain

### 2. Package Purpose
- Packages provide specific business purposes
- Handle necessary data transformations
- Focus on "what they do" rather than "what they contain"

### 3. Type System
- Each package defines its own type system
- Types represent both incoming and outgoing data
- Prefer concrete types (users, products, sales) for clarity

### 4. Polymorphism Usage
- Use interfaces for behavior-based operations
- Runtime polymorphism: achieved through interfaces
- Static polymorphism: achieved through generics

### 5. Interface Guidelines
- Use interfaces as input types when needed
- Avoid interfaces as return types
- Let callers handle data decoupling
- Return concrete type pointers for clarity 

### 6. Application Layer
- App layer must be agnostic to the protocol layer
- Business logic should be independent of delivery mechanisms
- Enables flexibility to change protocols without affecting core functionality
- Promotes clean separation of concerns and testability
